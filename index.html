    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Where do they work?</h3>
    <p>The interactive chart below shows the range of sectors and subsectors of the economy that employ our alumni. The industries are based on the <b><i><a href='https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/index.html' target="_blank">North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a></b></i>, a standardized industry classification system used by federal statistical agencies. NAICS offers different levels of detail. The NAICS 2 digit sector codes provide a higher level of aggregation, whereas the NAICS 3 digit sector codes offer a narrower, more-detailed description. You can toggle between the two using the buttons below the graphic. Numbers on the graph refer to the percentage of graduates employed in a particular sector or industry.
    
    <p> Data for this study were obtained from the Ohio Longitudinal Data Archive (OLDA). The OLDA is a data repository that is comprised of public administrative records on education, work, and training experiences of Ohio residents over time. The OLDA is a project of the <b><i><a href="http://oerc.osu.edu/" target="_blank">Ohio Education Research Center</a></b></i>.</p>

  <p>Due to confidentiality restrictions, not all information can be displayed. It is important to remember that this is a snapshot of our alumni. It is based on the number of students who graduated from The Patton College between 2013 and 2016 and remained in Ohio. Graduates who left the state are not included. Similarly, the self-employed and those employed by the federal government are excluded.</p>

          <h2>Important Caveats</h2>
          <p>The chart on the left shows the percentage of graduates accepting employment within six and twelve months. This information can be broken down by year and academic level. As before, the following restrictions apply: </p>
			  <ul>
				   <li id='alert'>Graduates who left Ohio are not captured in this analysis; differences in employment rates between graduate and undegraduate students are due to the significant percentage of nonresident students at the graduate level (37% vs 8%), many of whom return to their home state or country after graduation. <span class = 'alert' id='alert2'>Further, students who pursue advanced degrees are not included.</span></li>
				  <li>The data include students who graduated between 2013 and 2016 working both full-time and part-time; the self-employed and those employed by the federal government are excluded.</li>
			</ul>
